dnl We used to check for pthread.h first, but this fails if pthread.h
dnl requires special compiler flags (e.g. on True64 or Sequent).
dnl It gets checked for in the link test anyway.

dnl First of all, check if the user has set any of the PTHREAD_LIBS,
dnl etcetera environment variables, and if threads linking works using
dnl them:
if test x"$PTHREAD_LIBS$PTHREAD_CFLAGS" != x; then
  save_CFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
  CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS"
  save_LIBS="$LIBS"
  LIBS="$PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS"
  AC_MSG_CHECKING([for pthread_join in LIBS=$PTHREAD_LIBS with CFLAGS=$PTHREAD_CFLAGS])
  AC_TRY_LINK_FUNC(pthread_join, pthreads=yes)
  AC_MSG_RESULT($pthreads)
  if test x"$pthreads" = xno; then
    PTHREAD_LIBS=""
    PTHREAD_CFLAGS=""
  fi
  LIBS="$save_LIBS"
  CFLAGS="$save_CFLAGS"
fi

dnl We must check for the threads library under a number of different
dnl names; the ordering is very important because some systems
dnl (e.g. DEC) have both -lpthread and -lpthreads, where one of the
dnl libraries is broken (non-POSIX).

dnl Create a list of thread flags to try.  Items starting with a "-" are
dnl C compiler flags, and other items are library names, except for "none"
dnl which indicates that we try without any flags at all, and "pthread-config"
dnl which is a program returning the flags for the Pth emulation library.

pthread_flags="pthreads none -Kthread -kthread lthread -pthread -pthreads -mthreads pthread --thread-safe -mt pthread-config pth-config"

dnl When cross configuring, we're always using GCC, and we always have a platform
dnl with pthreads in that case, but it's often sonewhere non-standard, so
dnl unless this is a problem, assume we don't need any special flags.
if test x$cross_compiling = xyes; then
    pthread_flags="none"
fi

dnl The ordering *is* (sometimes) important.  Some notes on the
dnl individual items follow:

dnl pthreads:	AIX (must check this before -lpthread)
dnl none:	in case threads are in libc; should be tried before -Kthread and
dnl 		other compiler flags to prevent continual compiler warnings
dnl -Kthread:	Sequent (threads in libc, but -Kthread needed for pthread.h)
dnl -kthread:	FreeBSD kernel threads (preferred to -pthread since SMP-able)
dnl lthread:	LinuxThreads port on FreeBSD (also preferred to -pthread)
dnl -pthread:	Linux/gcc (kernel threads), BSD/gcc (userland threads)
dnl -pthreads:	Solaris/gcc
dnl -mthreads:	Mingw32/gcc, Lynx/gcc
dnl -mt:		Sun Workshop C (may only link SunOS threads [-lthread], but it
dnl		doesn't hurt to check since this sometimes defines pthreads too;
dnl		also defines -D_REENTRANT)
dnl		... -mt is also the pthreads flag for HP/aCC
dnl pthread:	Linux, etcetera
dnl --thread-safe: KAI C++
dnl pth(read)-config: use pthread-config program (for GNU Pth library)

  dnl On Solaris (at least, for some versions), libc contains stubbed

  dnl tests will erroneously succeed.  (We need to link with -pthreads/-mt/
  dnl -lpthread.)  (The stubs are missing pthread_cleanup_push, or rather
  dnl a function called by this macro, so we could check for that, but
  dnl who knows whether they'll stub that too in a future libc.)  So,
  dnl we'll just look for -pthreads and -lpthread first:
